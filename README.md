# DSM-Project
Into to Data Science and Mining Final Project

## Project Goal

  The goal of this project is to answer the question:
  "What trends or factors determine a DDoS attack?"

## Methods

  The primary method that makes this project successful is to use a supervised model to effectively classify the data and find the specific patterns that make up a definite attack.

  The outcome of this method should be to make a chart to visualize the data contained within the dataset to allow for a visual aid within the final poster that this project makes up.

## Dataset

  All data is gathered from [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymenabb/ddos-evaluation-dataset-cic-ddos2019)


# Procedure

## Preparing the data

### Initial Questions:

- What does it look like?
- What features does it have?
- What features is it missing?
- Is the data good? Does it make sense?
- Is the data complete?
- Does it answer your question?

### Fixing Missing Data

  To fix any missing or corrupted data captured within this dataset, I will approximate the data using the mode and/or median.
